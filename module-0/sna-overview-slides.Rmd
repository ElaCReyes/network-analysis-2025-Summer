## Share Your Story

Think of a moment when you felt most surprised by connections!

.font80[
**Consider sharing about:**
- A breakthrough moment in your research
- A time when collaboration clicked perfectly
- A moment of unexpected connection with students/colleagues]

Give participants 2-3 minutes to think, then share in pairs or small groups
Can also do this as a full group share if time permits

# The Four Hallmarks of SNA

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Relationships]

Social network analysis is based on .red[**ties**] connecting social .red[actors] (aka nodes, people) and is motivated by our intuition that relationships between individuals matter:

- no individual is an island, independence is .red[**NOT**] assumed
- .red[who] we know, are friends with, or talk with matters
- the influence of these relations is shaped by the larger network
- location in a social structure shapes one's opportunities and outcomes

]

.panel[.panel-name[Empirical Data]
It is firmly grounded in **systematic empirical data collection** using methods refined over decades and methods still evolving:

- observations of social context
- surveys and questionnaires 
- historical and administrative records
- digital learning tools and social networking sites

]

.panel[.panel-name[Graphical Imagery]

.pull-left[
It makes use of .red[**graphic imagery**] (graph theory) to represent actors and their relations with one another.

- Shapes for actors (nodes, vertices)
- Lines for relations (ties, edges, arcs)

In social network analysis, CONCOR stands for CONvergence of iterated CORrelations. It is an algorithmic method used to partition a social network into groups, or ‚Äúblocks,‚Äù of nodes that are structurally equivalent‚Äîmeaning they have similar patterns of relationships with other nodes in the network.

QAP stands for Quadratic Assignment Procedure, which is a statistical method used in social network analysis. It‚Äôs a permutation test specifically designed to analyze dyadic data (data involving pairs of entities) while controlling for the non-independence that is inherent in network data.
The QAP works by ‚Äúscrambling‚Äù or permuting the dependent variable data through several iterations to create multiple random datasets. This permutation approach creates a sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, allowing for statistical significance testing when traditional methods might be inappropriate due to the interdependence of observations in network data.

# Applications of SNA

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Overview]
Interest in SNA as an alternative method for studying educational phenomena such has grown tremendously in the past few decades:

- Diffusion and adoption of innovations 
- Social influence 
- Belief systems 
- Social capital 
- Homophily 
- Efficacy of interventions 
- Small-group dynamics

]

.panel[.panel-name[Social Capital]
SNA provides a means to actually measure & model social capital and has be used to better understand:

- how social relations advantages some students (Maroulis and Gomez, 2008)
- dropout among Latino/a/ex students (Ream and Rumberger, 2008) 
- school-oriented friendship networks have the potential to reduce dropout rates
- parental social closure and student math achievement (Morgan and Todd, 2008)
]

.panel[.panel-name[Selection & Influence]
Educational researchers have used modeling of peer selection and influence to better understand: 

- who school leaders collaborate and confide in and why (Daly and Finnigan, 2010)
- how the characteristics of friends shape students‚Äô aspirations and college attendance (Hallinan & Williams, 1990) 
- teachers‚Äô attitudes toward school and district reforms (Cole & Weinbaum, 2010)


]

.panel[.panel-name[Diffusion]
Building on theories of diffusion, SNA has been used to explain how ideas and resources spread within and between networks of actors, such as: 

- attitudes and use of computers in classrooms over time (Frank et al., 2011)
- how substance abuse diffuses across adolescent networks (Valente et al., 2004)
- diffusion of charter school policy and creation across states (Renzulli and Roscigno, 2005)

# Discussion
Consider a social network of which you are a part. 
1. Who are the members or .red["actors"] in this network? 

1. What relationships or .red["ties"] connect these actors? 

1. Are there any groups or .red["cliques"] (aka groups) within this network?  

1. Are there any actors that .red["central"] to this network?
