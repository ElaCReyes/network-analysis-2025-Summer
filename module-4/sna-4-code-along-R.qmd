Guiding Research & the ERGM Package

## Guiding Study

::: panel-tabset
### Context

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
This longitudinal case study **examines reform-related knowledge, advice, and innovation network structures** among administrators in a district under sanction for under-performance and engaging in district-wide reform efforts.
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
![Ebb and Flow of Social Network Ties [@daly2011ebb]](img/daly-net.jpeg)
:::
:::

### Questions

This study involves quantifying and visualizing the ties and overall structure of informal networks to answer the following research questions:

1.  In what ways have reform-related social networks between district and site leaders evolved over a 2-year period?

2.  How do district and school leaders perceive the evolution of the social networks and its effect on the exchange of reform-related resources within the district?

### Data

To answer RQ1, Daly and Finnigan administered **online survey consisting of network relations and demographic questions** asking participants to:

-   select the administrators in the La Estasis network that they interact with for the purpose of **advice seeking, collaboration, knowledge exchanges**,

-   assess their relationships on a **5-point interaction scale** ranging from 1 (no interaction) to 5 (1 to 2 times a week).

### Findings

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### QAP

-   weak correlation between knowledge and innovation and advice and innovation

-   leaders with knowledge ties also likely to have advice relations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### P-Star (SIENA)

-   Leaders with more experience more likely to be selected for reform-related advice

-   over time, leaders tended to create ties with those frequently identified as resources for innovative practices
:::
:::

### Takeaways

Overall, the findings from SNA and qualitative interviews indicate that over time:

1.  Networks increased the number of superficial interactions.

2.  More frequent exchanges, however, remained unchanged.

3.  The result was a centralized network structure.

## Guiding Question

::: panel-tabset
### Research Question

<br>

*Does gender or some other individual attribute predict confidential exchanges between school leaders?*

### ergm ðŸ“¦

-   ERGMs are the primary building blocks of statistically testing network structural effects.

-   Uses simulation to determine the probability of network feature (e.g., reciprocity, clique, homophily)

-   Evolved to allow actor attributes for covariates

-   The {ergm} package is used to fit exponential-family random graph models (ERGMs) in R

### Your Turn

Let's start by creating a new R script and loading the following packages:

-   tidyverse

-   ergm

-   statnet

-   tidygraph

-   ggraph

``` r
# YOUR CODE HERE
#
#
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ergm)
library(statnet)
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
```
:::

# Wrangle

Import Data & Tidy Graph

## Import Data

::: panel-tabset
### Import Data

Let's import two Excel files from the Social Network Analysis and Education companion site. year_1_collaboration.xlsx

```{r}
#| echo: true
leader_nodes <- read_csv("data/school-leader-nodes.csv")
leader_edges <- read_csv("data/school-leader-edges.csv")
```

### Inspect Data

Using your R script, take a look at the node and edge lists we just imported:

``` r
# ADD CODE BELOW
#
#
```

### Discuss

Think about the questions below and be prepared to share your response:

1.  What do you think the values for each tie represent?

2.  What do you think the "trust" and "efficacy" variables represent?

3.  What else do you notice about this data?

4.  What else do you wonder about this data?

**Hint**: Take a look at the SNA in Ed [companion site](https://studysites-sagepub-com.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/carolan/study/resources.htm)

### Answer

-   Edge values indicate the frequency of interactions leaders have with nominated individuals on a four-point frequency scale ranging from 1 (the least frequent) to 4 (1â€“2 times a week).

-   `efficacy` measures a belief in their ability to have an effect derived from a scale that includes 18 items rated on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (None at all) to 9 (A great deal).

-   `trust` measures perceptions of the level of trust their school and district is a composite score based on scale contains eight items rated on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree).

## Convert to "Network"

::: panel-tabset
### as.network() function

The {ergm} package requires an object of the class "network" â€” the format that {statnet} uses to store and work with network data.

The `as.network()` function does just that. Run the following code in your console to pull up the help page for the `as.network()` function and let's take a look:

``` r
?as.network
```

### Convert to Network

Run the following code in your R script to combine our edge and node lists into a single "network" object:

```{r}
#| echo: true

leader_network <- as.network(leader_edges,
                             vertices = leader_nodes)

```

### Check Class

Now let's use the `class()` function to verify that it is indeed a network object/data structure:

```{r}
#| echo: true
class(leader_network)


```

# Explore

Network Stats & A Quick Sociogram

## View Network

::: panel-tabset
### Inspect Network

First, let's take a quick look at our network by printing

```{r}
#| echo: True

leader_network
```

### Visualize Network

Now use the `plot()` or `autograph()` function to create a quick sociogram

``` r
# YOUR CODE HERE
#
#
```

### Output

```{r}
autograph(leader_network)
```

# Model

Model Specification & ERGM Parameters

## Base ERGM

::: panel-tabset
### Model Specification

The syntax for specifying a model in theÂ `ergm`Â package followsÂ **R**'s formula convention: `my_network ~ ergm_term_1 + ergm_term_2 + ergm_term_3` and so forth.

In the Help tab, search for "ergm-terms" and select the `ergm::ergm-terms` help page to take a quick peek at the plethora of parameters you can include in your model.

### ERGM 1

Let's start with with a simple model that contains the following ergm-terms

-   **`edges`** a required term that represents the total number of edges in the network

-   **`mutual`** examines the tendency for ties to be reciprocated, i.e. "mutuality".

``` r
# ensure reproducibility of our model
set.seed(589) 

# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_1 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual) 

# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_1)
```

### Interpret

```{r}
# ensure reproducibility of our model
set.seed(589) 

# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_1 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual) 

# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_1)
```
:::

## ERGM 2

::: panel-tabset
### Confidential Ties

Let's now test for homophily -- or the "birds of a feather" phenomenon -- in our network. The `ergm()` function now includes a `nodematch()` term to answer the following question:

*Are school leaders more likely to confide in colleagues of their own gender or who work at the same site level (e.g., school vs. central office)?*

``` r
# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_2 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual + nodematch('male') + nodematch('district_site')) 

# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_2)
```

### Interpret

```{r}
# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_2 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual + nodematch('male') + nodematch('district_site')) 
# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_2)
```
:::

## ERGM 3

::: panel-tabset
### Trust Ties

*Are school leaders with higher levels of trust more likely to have confidential exchanges?*

``` r
# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_3 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual + nodematch('male') + nodematch('district_site') + nodecov('trust')) 

# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_3)
```

### Interpret

```{r}
# fit our ergm model 
ergm_mod_3 <-ergm(leader_network ~ edges + mutual + nodematch('male') + nodematch('district_site') + nodecov('trust')) 

# get summary statistics for our model
summary(ergm_mod_3)
```
